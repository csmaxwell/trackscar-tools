# TrackScar tools

This is a repo to keep track of the ImageJ macros and misc python and R scripts used to analyze TrackScar data as well as the TrackScar protocol. There are two tutorial files to be aware of:

- [trackscar-protocol.org](trackscar-protocol.org) is the official TrackScar tutorial. It can be viewed directly on github, but is also asa PDF using `ox-latex` for ease of printing.

- [trackscar-image-processing.org](trackscar-image-processing.org) contains a detailed tutorial of how to use the scripts `makeCountList`, `mergeDV`, and the various macros (eg `TrackScar.txt`, `TrackScar segmentation.txt`, etc.).
